# superstring

A super string class for C++

```
                        .    .
                         )  (
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _(.--.)
 {{ { { { { { { { { { { ( '_')
  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>`--'>
```

This class implements a kitchen sink full of extra features and functions, including tokenization, parsing, and others, similar to Java or Scala's String class.

The next update (?) will include unit tests, UTF-8 support, and per-project feature sets. For now, this is unoptimized and *untested*, so use it at your own peril. Much of this code consists of various bits and pieces, and functions I have aggregated over the years from one project or another. If you are writing mission-critical code, you might be better served using the [boost::string](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/doc/html/string_algo.html) library.
